# with-mcp-skill

Tests agent performance when the Svelte team's official MCP skill is available, which points the agent to documentation and tooling for SvelteKit. This tests whether a model-context-protocol-backed skill meaningfully improves implementation accuracy for a feature (remote functions) that is outside the model's training data.
